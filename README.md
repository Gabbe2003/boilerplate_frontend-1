The width of the author/ published date and social media is not the same either the image or the post body?
We were complaining that the width is to big and not it is 90%



<!-- Future -->
There is few things i am planning to implement and one of them is the improvment of the categories we have in the sense of what they offer. The problem with many news webpappers is that the posts dies after a short amount of time. There is no direct cure to that, but at the very least one could benefit from those post evern if they are idle. What we can do i for example in the förtag section add a for example top 50 compaines in sweden. We fetch the information from different reliable sources for example inforamtion about the company, its plans and overall information about it, making it like a time line. Almost like a folder that one could enter and view the articles about that specific company. This way we can build up our internal linking, make our företag more of use, old posts doesnt die that easily and then we can rank better on new keywords. Finanlly we can also add a analyzation section where we summrize that inforamtion that we have based on the 10 most read articles and then we make an assessment for example if this website will do good or not, this is ofcourse based on AI but it is still something that is new and can make people spend much more time on the site reading more interesting analyzes
