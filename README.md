6. Use ZOD for security for the Link purchase - Kerlos (Done)
7. Have fallback on all the API calls - Kerlos (Done)


Consitency:
1. Move everything to Tailwind varibals - Gabbe
2. Look into Shadcn more to see for components and stuff like that - Gabbe
3. Use one importing convention either named(preferable) or default - Kerlos (Done)
4. Cleanup types, move them into /types if it's used more than once - Kerlos (Done) We should fix better the types better, as of now we are just making it work by just putting anything inside of the types. We should build a types that when we get an error then we dont fix the type to prevent the error but now that the response is wrong. ðŸ¤£

SEO: 

 1. Render Meta data - Kerlos (Done)

Optimizations:

1. React-vertualized - Kerlos (Done), not a bad choice and can be used in listing when the scrollbehavior doesnt fuck the design

3. Also Also runtime = edge can increase performance - Kerlos
4. Reduce api calls - Kerlos
5. Delay Search request by 1 sec - Gabbe

7. We are importing 
import Link from 'next/link';6 times
import Image from 'next/image'; 5 times 


6. Dynamic loading here; src\lib\graph_queries\getPostBySlug.ts; do we need revalidate there, and maybe cache options
